TASK:
The file football.dat contains the results from the English Premier League
for 2001/2. The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals
scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals
against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Your program should
download the file and print the name of the team with the smallest difference
in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.

Things that should be taken into consideration (among the others):
Test coverage
Code style (DRY, YAGNI, KISS, …)
Output readability


REQUIREMENTS:
python 2.7


INSTALLATION:
pip install -r requirements.txt
